                                Souls is a type of game genre that consists of RPG games widely known in the gaming community for their difficulty. <b>FromSoftware</b> is a Japanese video game development and publishing company responsible for the souls games. This genre includes a variety of games from the more popular <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy to the 2022 game of the year, <i>Elden Ring</i>. The name of this genre is due to the <i>Dark Souls</i> series which all started in the year 2009-2011 with the release of <i>Demon's Souls</i>, the precursor to <i>Dark Souls</i>, and the original Darks Souls</i>. These two games introduced various mechanics which are a characteristic of the souls games. For starters the upgrading system which is similar among all games of this genre in which you defeat enemies to earn a currency which is used for various things such as leveling up and the more you increase your level the more expensive the upgrade cost with a less impact as well.</br>

                                <i>Demon's Souls</i>, first released on Playstation 3 platforms exclusively in 2009, as mentioned before is the precursor to <i>Dark Souls</i>, kickstarting the <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy. <i>Demon's Souls</i> set place in a western like style and follows a generic story of evil unleashed. This game introduces the basic mechanics for all souls games from the fighting to the upgrade system. This game as it is a couple generations old lacks in every area compared to the others however one can truly tell that it paved way for the souls genre. As if being an experimental game to see the reaction of the gaming community, <i>Demon's Souls</i> feels like the beta verzion for the original <i>Dark Souls</i>. The graphics were quite decent for its time and were for the most part consistent throughout although it sure is not near to the experience of the other souls games which came out years later. Approximately 14 years after its original release, <i>Demon's Souls</i> makes a return to the big screen with its remastered version exclusively on Playstation 5 in 2020. Strange as it may seem the remastered verzion of <i>Demon's Souls</i> plays identical to the original and to sum that is great and to others a dissapointment, however, what isn't identical and should be expected is the highly improved graphics which are in my opinion of par with <i>Elden Ring's</i>. The remastered brings about a immersively beautiful environment as well as improved sounds, moves, and animation. Although they are fundamentably the same, the 2020 version would take the prize as it is exactly the same as the original yet visually and aesthetically better. This is to be expected as the remastered <i>Demon's Souls</i> is exclusive to Playstation 5 the new generational console unlike the original that was exclusive to the Playstation 3 and could be emulated.

                                    The <i>Dark Souls</i> series is the more well known of the souls genre and consists of three great games, <i>Dark Souls</i>, <i>Dark Souls 2</i>, and <i>Dark Souls 3</i>. This trilogy began with the release of <i>Dark Souls</i> and later on continued with the release of <i>Dark Souls 2</i> in 2014. This series was well recieved and continued to develope with the release of <i>Dark Souls 3</i> in 2015. Although the series hadn't seen a new game in years it was recieved with a remastered version of the original <i>Dark Souls</i> in 2018 which up to now lives up to a great standard. <i>Dark Souls</i> followed the mechanics of <i>Demon's Souls</i> and expanded on them. The <i>Dark Souls</i> series brings about a new genre which throughout the gaming community is known for its mechanics and difficulty. Although they all seem to share the same gameplay <b>FromSoftware</b> developed <i>Dark Souls 2</i> differently when trying to make it more original, introducing variously new

                                    <i>Sekiro:Shadow Die Twice</i>, debatebly known as the hardest of the souls games, is a a 2019 action-adventure game developed by <b>FromSoftware</b> and released for the PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One. <i>Sekiro</i> is unlike all other souls games in which it lacks the role-playing aspect meaning that if you wish to create your own avatar and mess around this game is not for you, however, if you are more invested in a story then by all means this one is a better option. This game also lacks many of the mechanics that are seen in basically all the souls games, which include an upgrading system of stats and multiplayer elememnts. <i>Skeiro</i> also varies from other games in which you don't lower an enemies health point by attacking but by breaking their stance, posture and balance, as well as parrying their attacks which will give you and opening to harm them. Parrying isn't unique to Sekiro, however, it is more crucial and a skill that is recommended to master.

                                <i>Bloodborne</i>, it is essentially to <i>Dark Souls 3</i> what <i>Demon's Souls</i> was to <i>Dark Souls</i>. Some people might reffer to <i>Dark Souls 3</i> as a copy of it however it couldn't be the case because they are from the same company, sure they may be similar and to some it might seem like lazy development but it is this way because that's what the fans like. <i>Bloodborne</i> similar to <i>Demon's Souls</i> is a stand alone game relased for blank plataforms in blank. This game shares similar upgrade and fighting mechanics yet introduces a weapon never seen in the other games, a gun. Essentially this game holds its own but the graphics are, of course, not the greatest considering its age. Some people may consider this game the hardest yet it is often the case with those people that they run builds of slow movement with strength which in this game it isn't recommended. Like on most souls games vitality, an upgradable category, would be of more importance especially for beginners.

                                    Known as the game of the year for 2022, <i>Elden Ring</i>, is a phenomenal game that takes what all other souls games did and multiplied it by 100. Like others it is a third person role-playing game but unlike the rest it gives you free reign to explore the magnificent world that is the <i>Lands Between</i>. <i>Elden Ring</i> is truly deserving of the title "Game of the Year" as its gameplay is extremely entertaining and the visuals are phenomenal, allowing the player to immerse at a different scale than all the previous games. In <i>Elden Ring</i> you may do as you please, you may follow the story line, accept npc quests which will further enlighten you about the true plot of the game, or you may ignore all aspects of the game and kill or run aroung wherever you wish. The <i>Lands Between</i> is full of locations each with their unique aspects and marvelous items. As you continue to explore you may acquire items that will help you fight enemies. The wapons are amazing with some that are so unique that you may be able to wield them better the more you specialize your build to meet its criteria. Like other games you can beat the game with the weapon of your choice even if it isn't the greatest, although you might have a harder time.

                                    Although not developed by <b>FromSoftware</b>, the company that developed all other souls games, <i>Hollow Knight</i> is just as difficult and for that it's considered of the souls genre. It plays way differently than any of the games listed before, it is an amazing game with an immersive gameplay and story. I reccomend this game as well as all the others however if you like <i>Mario</i> or <i>Cuphead</i> you might also like this game. <i>Hollow Knight</i> is a 2d perspective game with an explorable map and incredible boss fights as well as awesome soundtracks. It might seem like a cute goofy game but remember it is known as a souls gmae for a reason.
